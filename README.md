# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This code is useful for extracting important keywords and named entities from the document.
* Flask API is used for this purpose.

### What can you do further ###

* Try to find the topic names given the keywords. I tried to use Glove for this but it was taking too much computational time.
* We can extract various other entities from a document like entity mention detection,linking pronouns to their respective nouns in a sentence.
